# TODO
### I want to redo the rules for this mode.
# Jon's rules for Play Poker specify using the spinner to vuk shot to lock the ball and show a card. That shot is a
# bitch to hit, even just throwing the ball up there by hand. I want to rework the mode to be a bit more fun to play and
# to utilize the cards printed around the left hole on the playfield.

# The spinner can be used to pick a card still. Hitting it plays the shuffle animation for a short period, maybe as
# little as 500ms, but I'm thinking 1s to 1.5s. It then lands on a card and flashes all the lights around the left hole.
# If the player wants that card, they can shoot the left hole to collect it, or they can hit the spinner again to get a
# different card.

# When the player shoots the left hole, we play an animation that locks in that card to their hand, then pop the ball
# back out, turning off the lights around the hole. The player then has to hit the spinner again to choose a card and
# the cycle repeats.

# The mode has a 30s timer, and you can add 5s by collecting a card. That means you can dick around with picking your
# cards, or you can just shoot, collect, and shoot again.

# We'll still use Jon's scoring table:

# 1 pair = 1,000,000 pts (he also says to award Mystery, but we haven't gotten that far)
# 2 pair = 2,000,000 pts (he also says to award Mystery, but we haven't gotten that far)
# 3 of a kind = 5,000,000 pts (he also says to award Managers Choice, but we haven't gotten that far)
# Full House = Extra Ball
# Straight = Extra Ball
# 4 of a kind = 1 Special (don't know what that is yet)
# 5 of a kind = 3 Specials (ditto)
# 5 Aces = Extra Ball, Special, Complete BROOKS N DUNN, 10M pts, and double score (?)

# Important Info #
##################

# A card is randomly selected when the spinner is hit. The random event player post an event like
# "poker_<card>_received", which we also can probably use to know which card is able to be collected.

# A card is collected when the "ball_lock_pp_collect_locked_ball" event posts.

# We need some ball locks

ball_locks:
  # General lock we use to hold the ball in the VUK during the mode
  # It enables when the mode starts and when the spinner is hit
  # It disables when the ball is released (since the spinner has to be hit to relight it)
  # When it's enabled and hit, it posts the event "ball_lock_poker_lock_locked_ball"

  # TODO will this keep the ball locked when the ball is in there already when the mode starts?
