# player needs to build a poker hand of 5 cards. The current selected card is
# changed by hitting the spinner, and that card is "locked in" by hitting the
# left VUK. Once the player locks in all five cards, the mode is complete and
# the player is awarded a prize based on the hand they built.

# Each hit of the spinner changes the selected card. Once a card is locked, it
# cannot be changed.

# This mode has a ball-to-ball memory and will pick up where it left off if
# it starts again.

# The mode has a 30s timer, and the player can add 5s by collecting a card.

# Scoring table:
# High card = 100,000 (can't use event params here)
# 1 pair = 1,000,000 pts (he also says to award Mystery, but we haven't gotten that far)
# 2 pair = 2,000,000 pts (he also says to award Mystery, but we haven't gotten that far)
# 3 of a kind = 5,000,000 pts (he also says to award Managers Choice, but we haven't gotten that far)
# Straight = Extra Ball
# Flush = Extra Ball
# Full House = Extra Ball
# 4 of a kind = 1 Special (don't know what that is yet)
# Straight Flush = 3 Specials (ditto)
# Royal Flush = Extra Ball, Special, Complete BROOKS N DUNN, 10M pts, and double score (?)

#todo
# Need to make this move faster - maybe a timeout of 10s to shoot the spinner before the card 
# is automatically locked in, at which point it moves on to the next card.
