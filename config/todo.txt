#ToDo 

- Figure out weak flippers mode. I got weak flippers working, and there are enable/disable events for it,
  but nothing else after that. 

    - Can we slow down music with code so we don't lose the spot in the track?
      Worst case, we can cross-fade to the next track, but that's a lot of work.

    - Mode should double all scores during mode (not bonus, in case the ball drains) 

- Figure out how to add "hold album value" to Mystery awards. Also add weak flippers to mystery
  awards when figured out

- Skill shot needs to end as soon as another switch it hit. It's configured to remove the slide from the stage
  but it doesn't do it right away.

- Figure out how Manager's Choice should work. I have it configured to kick off if the ball 
  drops down the hole at the top of the red ramp, but I don't actually know what happens then, 
  or how that shot even gets lit. 
  
    - Does the mode even work? I don't think it's ever been enabled.

- Does Hi/Lo work? How is it lit?
  
- Completing all modes, then shooting ramp to light Begin Round crashes game when it should light Begin Round (or something to start metal rodeo)

- Make sure WT multiball works and scores points and stuff. It was pretty busted up when it was also the JB multiball. 

- When Bonus mode is enabled, a ball never ends. I think there's a queue event holding it up, but I don't know what it is.
