#ToDo 

- Fix play_poker mode. Config has empty image: widgets, that I think are placeholders for code. 
  This was probably non-standard YAML before, and it's tripping up the new config validator.

     - Also need to make this move faster - maybe a timeout of 10s to shoot the spinner before the card 
       is automatically locked in, at which point it moves on to the next card. 

     - Maybe it should lock the current card after 10s whether you shoot the left VUK or not, without
       extending the timer (like would happen if you shot the lock). 

- Albums mode probably needs redone since player vars aren't in counters anymore.

- Voice callouts

- Speed up eject from left vuk. seems to take too long. As I recall, this varies throughout the game.
  Could have been a 0.33 thing.

- Figure out weak flippers mode. what was i doing there? why didn't it work?

    - Can we slow down music with code so we don't lose the spot in the track?
      Worst case, we can cross-fade to the next track, but that's a lot of work.

    - Mode should double all scores during mode (not bonus, in case the ball drains) 

- Random videos in jukebox_mode? See note line 123 in jukebox_mode.yaml

- Figure out how to add "hold album value" to Mystery awards. Also add weak flippers to mystery
  awards when figured out

- Music Awards slide (line 389 in music_awards.yaml) needs to show whatever the actual score is 
  that we calculate as the mode progresses. Was this fixed? It's an old note.
