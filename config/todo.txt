#ToDo 

- Fix play_poker mode. Mode just kind of ends...I had 4 tens and it just ended without any fanfare.
  Also - I busted mode end, so it never ends

- Albums mode probably needs redone since player vars aren't in counters anymore.

- Voice callouts

- Speed up eject from left vuk. seems to take too long. As I recall, this varies throughout the game.
  Could have been a 0.33 thing.

- Figure out weak flippers mode. what was i doing there? why didn't it work?

    - Can we slow down music with code so we don't lose the spot in the track?
      Worst case, we can cross-fade to the next track, but that's a lot of work.

    - Mode should double all scores during mode (not bonus, in case the ball drains) 

- Figure out how to add "hold album value" to Mystery awards. Also add weak flippers to mystery
  awards when figured out

- Music Awards slide (line 389 in music_awards.yaml) needs to show whatever the actual score is 
  that we calculate as the mode progresses. Was this fixed? It's an old note.

- Skill shot needs to end as soon as another switch it hit. It's configured to remove the slide from the stage
  but it doesn't do it right away.
